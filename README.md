Tetriste is a soviet-themed falling-block game written in Java.

* It takes forever to load because of all the music
* It is worth the loading time because the music is awesome (and unlicensed, eek!)
* I wrote this for an undergrad class on data structures with the amazing late Professor Tim Huang (rest in peace)
