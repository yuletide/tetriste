#Tetriste

##Tetriste is a soviet-themed falling-block game written in Java.

* It takes forever to load because of all the music
* It is worth the loading time because the music is awesome (and unlicensed, eek!)
* I wrote this for an undergrad class on data structures with the amazing late Professor [Tim Huang](http://vision.middlebury.edu/~huang/publications.html "Publications") ([rest in peace](http://www.usgo.org/news/2011/06/in-memoriam-tim-huang/ "In Memoriam"))

###Coming in v2: Zeppelenins.
